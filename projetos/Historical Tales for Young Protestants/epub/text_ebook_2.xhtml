<p class="paragrafo"><span class="versalete">Fact</span> is as attractive as fiction, and is 
of much higher moral value. The pages 
of history contain incidents which 
equal in thrilling interest the most successful 
efforts of the human imagination. From 
its ample records, the following short 
stories, connected with the rise and progress 
of Scriptural Protestantism, have 
been selected. If it has been found 
necessary to advert to the dark deeds 
of the papacy, it is from the conviction 
that the principles and spirit in which 
they originated in former ages are not 
extinct in the present day. In supplying 
<span class="numeropagina" title="[viii]" id="pgn08">[viii]</span> books for the young, it may be well to 
make them the means of fortifying their 
minds against soul-destroying error, and 
of establishing them in those great doctrines 
in the defence of which their forefathers suffered and died.</p>
