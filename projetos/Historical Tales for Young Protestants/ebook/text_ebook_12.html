<h2 class='ti-2'>THE NUN OF JOUARRE</h2>
<p class='paragrafo'>JouARRE is a small town in Normandy. It once possessed a famous nunnery, which, though long since in ruins, is still remembered as the home of Charlotte de Bourbon.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>Charlotte,was born in the middle of the sixteenth [127] century. Her father, the duke of Montpensier, was of the royal house of Bourbon. As his proper ty had become reduced, and he could not give to his daughter the fortune due to her rank, he resolved that she should enter into a nunnery.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>This was a painful decision to his wife, who was a friend to the Protestant cause in France. But the duke was a stern Papist, and was resolved that his will should be obeyed. Before the time came for Charlotte to be shut out from the world, the mother often took her into a private chamber : there they wept and prayed together. In that retreat the young maiden was instructed in the blessed truths of the gospel—truths which were never wholly forgotten by her. And there, when a few years older, she signed, by desire of her mother, a paper, in which she protested against being forced into a nunnery, and claimed a right, when of riper years, to withdraw from it. It was at an early age, only thirteen, that Char lotte was to be closely confined by the bolts and bars of that prison-house—the convent at Jouarre. Her young heart had its joys and hopes. She loved her home. In her esteem the world was fair and bright, and full of pleasant scenes. Her nature and temper were active and lively, and she thought there was much for her to do and enjoy. But now she was called, in the days of her girlhood, to bid farewell to those she loved, and to be doomed, as it was called, to a religious life.', [128] The Papal church teaches that the surest way of pleasing God, and of leading a holy life, is to quit the world, and to retire to a convent. But the piety which the Bible enjoins is an active, living thing.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>It does not destroy the relations of life; it rather makes known the duties of them. It nowhere de clares that it is in solitude we are to exercise meek ness, patience, and love, but that it is in the midst of society all the graces of the Christian life are to be exercised and seen. We are to be m the world, though not of it. We are to u,e the world, though we are not to abuse it. Our light is to shine before men, that they may see our good works, and may glorify our Father who is in heaven. * Charlotte was taken by her father to the nunnery.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>Her flowing hair was cut away; her dress was coarse linen and haircloth ; a cord was tied around her waist; and with downcast looks she trod the iron-bound cloisters by day, and rested at night on the floor of her tomb-like cell. Was she now happy ? How could she be when she felt that she had been robbed of her freedom ? Did she find the repose that had been promised her? No; there were sullen discontent and strife where she had thought to meet with only peace and love. But never did she more painfully feel the loss of her liberty than when her mother fell suddenly ill ; for, either from the gloomy rules of the nunnery, or from the fears of her father lest her heart should * 1 Cor. vii. 31 ; Matt. v. 19.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>[129] be touched by the piety of the dying mother, she was not permitted to visit her. A daughter's care and love might have comforted the duchess in the hour of death ; but this last service of a child's af- f,tion was denied her. Neither was the young nun allowed to be present at the funeral, nor to visit the grave. A few years passed away, and the nun became reconciled to her state. She was told that her self- denial and sufferings were pleasing to God, and that the reward of her life would be certain glory in heaven. And so high was the character she obtain ed, that, though still very young, she was raised to be the principal of the convent—the lady-abbess of Jouarre. About this time light entered the doors of the convent, in the form of Protestant tracts. The lady- abbess read them, and they recalled to mind the loving words her mother had spoken to her in the secret chamber at home. The large Bible, and the truths it contained, the tears and prayers of her pious parent, the written protest, and her child- hood's happiness, were all as fresh in her memory as though they were things of yesterday. The Spirit of God blessed to her soul those plain words of the little tract—they led her to the cross of Christ. As the blind man rejoices when his eyes are opened to behold the shining of the sun, so did Charlotte when the light of the gospel beamed brightly on her heart. 12 [130] But could she now keep the glorious truths to herself ? Was it not her duty to make them known to others ? She was soon guided in the right path, and she began to teach the nuns that they must not hope, by their own merits, to win heaven, <br that salvation was by grace, through faith in Christ Jesus. From this time the life of a nun only filled her with distress ; it could not bring peace to her enlightened conscience. The counting of beads, and kneeling before an image of the Virgin Mary, and praying to saints, had become in her view only vanity and sin. But what was she to do? If she went to her father's house, he would thrust her from the door. If she fled to any other members of her family, they would despise her as one who had broken the most solemn vows. It was now that she felt her bondage. There was no one of whom she could seek advice, and in this uncertain state of mind she remained in the nunnery, guiding the minds of its inmates to a clearer knowledge of Christ. While thus engaged, news was brought to the nunnery that war had broken out in France. The Huguenots, after suffering years of oppression, had taken up arms, and were engaged in deadly strife with the Papists. It is sad for a land when civil war rages through its borders; and the more so, when it is a war of opposing religions. At length the conflict reached Normandy j and many were the [131] gad scenes there beheld of misery, bloodshed, and death.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>It was in the year 157l, that the noise of a battle was heard around the nunnery of Jouarre. It came nearer—to the very doors. These were soon broken open, and the nuns rushed forth to find a shelter in the woods. This was a critical season for Charlotte de Bourbon, She was driven into the world. Was it not a time for her, thus strangely set free, to act as her conscience told her, and to embrace the lib- erty that was so unexpectedly given to her ? Ought she any longer to hesitate in obeying the word of God? Should she not seek some place of safety where she might openly profess the doctrines she had cherished in her soul ? Yes ; the time had come ; but where could she find a home in France ? In such a trying hour there was not time to de liberate—she must act, and act without delay. Char lotte, therefore, hastily set out, passing from one place to another in disguise. There was no little danger in traveling in France in those days, when every one found on the road was suspected of being a Protestant. Yet she safely crossed the country, and after a time arrived at Heidelberg, in Germany.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>In that city she found many Christians ready to welcome her, and confirm her in the doctrines of the gospel.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>As might be supposed, there was no small stir when her flight was known. A nun had fled !</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>[132] Who could have supposed that a lady-abbess—the daughter of a duke, and of the royal family of France—would have abandoned the Papal church, and passed over to the Protestant faith ? There was dismay in the palace of the king. Confusion and debate were in the castles of the nobles, and in the convents of the land. Her father threatened that he would never forgive her. He mourned over her as one mourns over a child that has disgraced her family ; and as if to show his resentment, he rushed with greater zeal into the war with the Huguenots.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>The poor fugitive had foreseen all that would oc- cur when her flight was known. She would gladly have obeyed her father, and have rendered to him the love and honor due from a child. It was not self-will, nor a stubborn spirit, that led her to brave his threats. But how could she disobey God, or any longer deny his truth ? The words of the Saviour were not forgotten by her in this hour of trial : " He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me—and he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find itj, * Charlotte was now in a land where she could openly declare her faith ; and that she soon did, standing among thi3 Protestants of Heidelberg, and upheld by their prayers and good counsels, re- * Matt. X. 37—30.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>[133] nounced for ever the errors of the church of Rome.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>We must now turn our attention to the Low Countries, better known to many as the Nether lands. This is not one of the parts of Europe celebrated for its lofty mountains, or its lovely valleys, or its deep forest glades. It is mostly one unbroken flat, without hill or rock. But though not famous for its natural beauties, it has been long known as the land of religious freedom. Early in the sixteenth century the Protestant faith spread through all its towns and villages. The printer was set to work ; copies of the word of God were multi plied ; and many bold reformers preached the truth to the people.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>The Netherlands at this time belonged to the kingdom of Spain, whose sovereigns were most violent persecutors of Protestants. Large bands of soldiers were let loose among them, and thousands were put to death. The Inquisition was set up in all its terror : multitudes were confined in its dun geons, or by it given over to the rack and burning pile. One hundred thousand are said to have suf- fered for the truth's sake in the course of half a century. The patience of the people, however, was at length worn out. They had long sulfered the greatest injustice, and they resolved to cast off the iron yoke that was upon them. They rallied under 12* [134] the command of William, prince of Orange, and after a long contest, secured their freedom. The people of the Netherlands chose the prince as their ruler. He had been brought up in the court of Charles the Fifth, emperor of Spain, who was concerned that he should be educated as a strict Papist ; and the more so, as the father of the young prince was inclined to the Protestant faith. He, however, when grown to manhood, openly pro- fessed himself to be of that faith. The prince of Orange had often heard of the piety of Charlotte de Bourbon, and the sacrifices she had made in the cause of truth. And assured that she was fitted to adorn the highest station, he sought her hand, and she became his wife. She had been willing to return to her father's house on condition that he would not force her to renounce the Pro testant religion, but rather than agree to her wishes in this respect, he chose to give his consent to her marriage, in which case she would live at a distance from him and not annoy him by her presence. The nun of Jouarre was now raised, in the provi dence of Grod, to be the princess of Orange, and the first lady of rank in the Netherlands. And well did she adorn her high position. Meekness and prudence, charity and devotion, were at all times seen in her life. She was a pattern alike to the noble ladies at court, and to the lowly mothers in their families.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>[135] But dark shadows often come over the fairest earthly scenes. Some bitter drops mingle in the sweetest cup of worldly joy. A large reward had been offered to any one who should kill the prince, and a young Papist had agreed to attempt the horrid deed. To prepare him for his work he " confessed', to a priest ; and, under the influence of his wretched superstition, he kneeled in prayer that God would give him success in his design ! It was the Lord's day. The prince and princess of Orange had returned from Divine worship. As they were passing along the hall of their palace a shot was fired by the assassin, who had secretly ob- tained an entrance into the house. It entered the neck of the prince, who fell into the arms of his at- tendants. For some time he lay in great danger, his princess watching over him with the tenderest love. While dressing his wound, she at the same time spoke words of peace to encourage his hope in God. Her prayers were heard, and she had the delight of seeing him slowly restored to health. There was great joy in the city of Antwerp when the prince and princess went in state to the cathe dral, to return thanks for his merciful deliverance from the hands of the assassin. Nobles and burgo masters, citizens and soldiers were there, to unite with one voice in a song of praise. The church bells rang merrily, flags were hung at the mast- head of every ship, and sounds of gladness were l:eard through all the land.</p>
<p class='paragrafo'>[136] Not many months, however, had passed away before the health of the princess began to fail. Her tender frame had received a shock at the moment she saw her husband fall, which was further weak ened by her labor and watchings, night and day, by the side of his sick bed. Her days were now drawing to a close ; but in the midst of weariness and pain she knew in whom she had believed. Her soul and life had been given in faith to the Saviour; she had passed through many trials, and seen many changes ; and now, relying on the merits of Christ, she looked forward to a crown of glory, that fadeth not away. At her death there was great mourning in the land, and weeping crowds followed her body to its grave in the cathedral of Antwerp.</p>
