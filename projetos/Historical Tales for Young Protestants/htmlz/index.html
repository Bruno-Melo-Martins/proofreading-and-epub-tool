<p class="paragrafo"><span class="versalete">Fact</span> is as attractive as fiction, and is of much higher moral value. The pages of history contain incidents which equal in thrilling interest the most successful efforts of the human imagination. From its ample records, the following short stories, connected with the rise and progress of Scriptural Protestantism, have been selected. If it has been found necessary to advert to the dark deeds of the papacy, it is from the conviction that the principles and spirit in which they originated in former ages are not extinct in the present day. In supplying <span class="numeropagina" title="[viii]" id="pgn08">[viii]</span> books for the young, it may be well to make them the means of fortifying their minds against soul-destroying error, and of establishing them in those great doctrines in the defence of which their forefathers suffered and died.</p>

<h2 class="titulo titulo2" id="ti3">THE MERCHANT OF LYONS.</h2>
<p class="paragrafo_capitular"><span class="capitular"><img class="capitular1" src="A-chapter.jpg" alt="A"/></span>BOUT seven hundred years ago, there lived at Lyons, in France, a wealthy merchant named Peter Waldo. His house was on a tongue of land which divides the two beautiful rivers—the Rhone and the Saone. The walls of the city, even at that period, were old and grey. It was by gloomy gateways that the traveller entered into close, narrow streets. Houses six or seven stories high, were ornamented with richly carved work in wood ; and <span title="[10]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn10">[10]</span> their over-hanging roofs almost touched at the projecting parts, casting deep shadows on the pathway below. The town had been long noted for its com merce ; and the quays,'and wharfs on both rivers presented a busy scene. The place had then, for more than five hundred years, been the chief seat of the silk trade of France. The clicking sound of the loom was heard in almost every house. Numerous trees had been planted without the city walls, on which silk worms were bred, whose cocoons yielded the means of industry and were the source of wealth to the people.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">Peter Waldo had lived in great reputation as a merchant. Success had attended his labors, and he was known among his fellow-citizens as a man of honor, liberality and kindness of spirit. In the midst of his prosperity, an event took place, which led him to feel anxious for the salvation of his soul. He was sitting in the company of some friends. After supper, as they were engaged in pleasant con versation, one of them fell to the ground, and when he was raised it was found that he was dead ! From that time Waldo became a diligent inquirer after truth. He looked around, and saw the people carried away by sin, and then seeking to satisfy a guilty conscience with the false doctrines and vain ceremonies of the church of Rome. But in these peace was not to be found. The priests could not satisfy his mind as to the great question, How <span title="[11]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn11">[11]</span> shall man be just with God He knew he was a sinner; his conscience told him so. He knew he was not fit to die; and when he asked, "What must I do to be saved he was not satisfied with all the answers the priests of the church of Rome gave him. The Bible would have told him ; but Waldo had not the holy book. Rich as he was, he had not that best of all treasures : the few copies which then existed were in libraries to which the common people had not access. Besides, they were all written in Latin, so that a person had to be learn- ed in that tongue in order to read a Bible, provided he could by any means get sight of one.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">Some books of piety soon afterwards fell into the hands of Peter Waldo, written by the " early fa- thers," as they are called—pious men, who lived after the apostles, and before the Christian religion was corrupted by the priests of Rome. In these books he found many passages from the New Testa- ment, and much that brought light and comfort to his soul. These parts only made him more anxious to secure the whole of the Bible.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">After much labor, Peter Waldo was so happy as to own a copy of God's word. It must have been a large sum of money that he gave for it; yet what a treasure it proved to him ! He did not think the money misspent or the time misapplied that he gave to the study of it. These were nothing, in comparison with the blessed truths which it made <span title="[12]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn12">[12]</span> known to him. It taught him the "new and living way', of approaching God, through Jesus Christ, the only Saviour and Mediator ; it told him that a contrite and believing heart is what God requires ; it was heart service that was the reasonable ser vice.', Before, he was perplexed and troubled ; now, he was peaceful and glad. Peter Waldo felt like a new man; the burden was gone from his soul; light was there, and comfort, for he had found mercy through faith in Christ Jesus. Waldo had been long known in the city for his kindness to all. He had freely given of his wealth to relieve the wants of the people, but now, while he did not forget to give to those that needed, of the things that perish, he was more concerned that they should seek the bread of life for their souls. The Bible had taught him how he might be saved, and he desired to tell others the good news. He looked around, and beheld everybody groaning un der the heavy loads which the priests had put upon them. He wept over their condition, and with a pious zeal he entered the houses of his friends and fellow citizens that he might teach them about the great and precious work of Christ Jesus. He told them that God required only repentance, faith in his Son, and holy lives. He begged them to come to Jesus and have their sins washed away in his blood. He held many meetings with the poor in their cottages; he visited the sick and the dying; <span title="[13]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn13">[13]</span> he retired to the quiet of the country and the shel ter of the woods, that he might guide a few earnest seekers into the way of truth ; he taught them ; he prayed with them ; and relieved their distresses. We need not wonder that the people loved him, since he was concerned to feed both their bodies and their souls.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">tures might be translated into the language of the 2* <span title="[14]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn14">[14]</span> people. The translation then in use was the Vul gate, so called because it was to be for common,' use in the churches. It was in the Latin tongue ; and though the languages of Europe had a mixture of Latin words in them, they were still so unlike it that the common, or vulgar people, (formerly the word vulgar was of the same sense as common) could not read it, even if they had been permitted to do so. What should we do without the Bible in our own language ? The Bible in Latin would be a useless book to most of us; and yet it was just the plan of the priests of Rome to keep it in another tongue that others might be ignorant of its sacred truths. "The people must have it in their own tongue," said Peter Vfaldo, and the work was soon begun.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">It is not quite certain whether he translated it him self, or caused it to be done by others. Perhaps he did a part of it, and engaged able persons to do the rest.It was a very great labor; but having read the Bible himself, he spared neither money nor pains that it might be placed in the hands of his country- men. At length, some of the books were completed, and this was the Jirst translation of the Bible into a modern language. It was done by, or at the ex- pense of, a rich merchant. Did ever a man of wealth do a better work ? What a blessed gift it was to the people of that land !</p>
<p class="paragrafo"><span title="[15]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn15">[15]</span> When the Bible was finished, it could not be largely circulated ; for this was before the art of printing was known. Written copies had to be made with the pen, demanding long and patient labor; and when finished, a complete copy was worth a large sum of money. The pious merchant, however, had numerous copies of the New Testa- ment written, that they might be freely given to the people : and many had the privilege of reading it in their own language. All honor to the brave and good man who thus gave the word of Grod to the men of France ! But this great service was not enough for Peter Waldo. He was not only the founder of a Bihle SocietyJ but he began to form also a Missionary So ciety. Great numbers in the city had been brought, through the teaching of the Holy Spirit, to love the Saviour, and these he sent out, two by two, into all the region around. They carried their books with them into other lands. Multitudes were led to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, through the humble efforts of these "poor men of Lyons," as they were called. These colporteurs, or book-hawkers, not only made their way into the homes of the lowly, but found access to the castles of the nobles. Their manner, as we are told, was to carry a box of trinkets, or other goods, and travel about the country as pedlars.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">When they entered the houses of the gentry, to sell <span title="[16]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn16">[16]</span> some of their wares, they cautiously made known that they had other goods that were far more valu- able than these —precious jewels, which they would show if they might be permitted to do so. They would then bring them from their pack, or from under their cloak, a Bible or Testament, and as they spoke of its worth, they urged that this holy book might find a place in the homes and hearts of those who heard them. In this way many of the nobles and gentry were brought to possess the word of Grod. A poet has described one of these hawkers displaying jewels and silks to view, and thus ad- dressing the lady of the castle : " 0 lady fair, I have yet a gem, Whicli a purer lustre flings. Than the diamond flash of the jewel'd crown. On the lofty brow of kings. A wonderful pearl of exceeding price, Whose virtue shall not decay ; Whose light shall be as a guide to thee, And a blessing on thy way." The lady glanced at the mirroring steel Where her form of grace was seen Where her eyes shone clear, and her dark locks waved Their clasping pearls between : " Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth, Thou traveller grey and old ; And name the price of thy precious gem, And my pages shall count thy gold." The cloud went off from the pilgrim's brow, As a small and meagre book, Unchased with gold or diamond gem, From his folding robe he took ; <span title="[17]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn17">[17]</span> " Here, lady fair, is the pearl of price, May it prove as such to thee !</p>
<p class="paragrafo">Nay, keep thy gold—I ask it not, For the word of God is free." The hoary traveller went his way But the gift he left behind Hath had its pure and perfect work On that high-horn maiden's mind ; And she hath turned from the pride of sin, To the lowliness of truth, And given her trustful heart to God In its beautiful hour of youth. It was not to be supposed that the pope and the priests looked quietly upon the labors of Peter Waldo and his book-hawkers. The pope anathematized him, or pronounced him accursed, and ordered the archbishop of Lyons to proceed against him with the greatest rigor. The archbishop was very will- ing to obey. "If you teach any more/, said he to the merchant, "I will have you condemned as a heretic and burnt." How can I be silent in a matter which concerns the salvation of men he boldly answered. Offi- cers were sent to secure him, but they feared the people, to whom Peter Waldo had become endear ed. During three years he was concealed by his. friends. At length the merchant could stay at Lyons no longer in safety. He fled from the city, going from place to place, everywhere explaining and teaching Bible truth; and God blessed his labors.</p>
<p class="paragrafo"><span title="[18]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn18">[18]</span> Waldo and his missionaries were treated very badly by their enemies ; they were called sorcer- ers," cut-purses," and tur-lupins," or people living with wolves. They had often nowhere to lay their heads, and were forced to find refuge in the forest. Poor men of Lyons'' became a term of reproach. It could be said of them, as of good men in Bible times, " They wandered in deserts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth, be- ing destitute, afflicted, tormented and it may be truly added, Of whom the world was not worthy." —Heb. xi. 37, 38. While burning at the stake, they praised Grod for the privilege of laboring and suffering for Him who had died on the cross for them. Thirty-five pious men and women were burned in one fire, and eighteen suffered martyr dom at another time. God's blessed truth, however, cannot be burned out, or rooted out, or put out, by any way of men's devising. Grod himself will take care of it. In spite of the anger of their enemies, in all the coun tries whither Peter Waldo and his missionaries went, the truth made its way, converting and comforting many souls. Thus were planted the seeds, the little seeds, of true Bible religion, which, three or four hundred years afterwards, sprang up and aided in promoting the great Protestant Reformation—that Reformation which established Bible religion again on the earth, and gave a great blow to the power of the pope.</p>
<p class="paragrafo"><span title="[19]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn19">[19]</span> But what became of Peter Waldo ? After doing much good, and presenting a noble example as a Christian, he went into Bohemia, where he peace fully died, in the year 1179. From that time to this present day his name is held in great respect — not merely or chiefly because he was a great mer chant or a rich man—but because he gave himself and his all to the service of our Lord ; and because he was the first in Europe to give the word of Grod to the common people in their own language.</p>
<p class="paragrafo">Many of the followers of Peter Waldo, after long and great trial, joined the Vaudois, or Waldenses* a hardy and simple-minded people, who had never submitted to the church of Rome. They were one ' in faith, and they were now willing to live together as mutual helps in the gospel. Thus united, though almost unknown to the world, they were, for ages, like a little flock,,' dwelling alone in the lovely and quiet valleys of Piedmont. It is true, that persecutors, as fierce wolves, often broke upon the fold to worry and destroy them ; but to the present day "a remnant', has been left, who continue faith- ful to the truth. As we read of those who have formed a part of the church in other days, may we feel a concern to par- take of the same faith—that faith which savingly *The Waldenses existed centuries before Waldo. The name Waldo is taken either from a Latin word meaning one who lives in a dense valley, that is, a dalesman ; or from a German word meaning one who lives in a wood. <span title="[20]" class="numeropagina" id="pgn20">[20]</span> unites the soul to Christ, and which will keep it steadfast to his cause in a sinful world. Then in the kingdom of glory we shall meet with all those, from every land, who passed through fiery trials on earth, and who, having washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb," shall stand before the throne of God for ever. —Rev. vii. 14.</p>
